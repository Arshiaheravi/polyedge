*(All 3 tasks completed or confirmed already covered in session 211)*

## PRIORITY 11 — Coverage Gaps (generated session 213 via low-water-mark check)

- [ ] **web-push-config `available=True` branch** — `GET /alerts/web-push-config` with VAPID key configured should return `available=True` and the key string. The existing test only covers `available=False`. Grep: `grep -n "available.*true\|vapid.*available.*true" backend/tests/test_alerts.py` should return nothing for this specific branch assertion.

- [ ] **Stripe webhook unknown plan falls back to "basic"** — `_handle_checkout_completed` uses `PLAN_TIER_MAP.get(plan, "basic")`, so a webhook with `plan="enterprise"` sets `subscription_tier="basic"`. No test covers this fallback. Add to `test_stripe_service.py`. Grep: `grep -n "enterprise\|unknown.*tier\|fallback.*basic" backend/tests/test_stripe_service.py` returns nothing.

- [ ] **`GET /bettors/{address}` unauthenticated returns `tier:"free"` locked simulator** — already tested by `test_bettor_detail_unauthenticated_copy_simulator_locked`. If grep confirms covered, remove this task. Grep: `grep -n "unauthenticated.*copy.*simulator\|copy_simulator.*unauthenticated" backend/tests/test_bettors.py`

## FEATURE MODE — Competitive Intelligence (do not implement in DEBUG mode)

- [ ] **Min-bet-size filter per follow** — add a `min_bet_usd` field to `BettorFollow` model (default 0). Scheduler skips notifications when `bet_amount < follow.min_bet_usd`. Reduces noise from small test trades. Highest-demand competitive differentiator vs Polycule/PolycopytradBot per 2026 research. (Source: BRAIN session 203 competitor analysis — "every competing tool has min trigger amount filter")

- [ ] **Rich push notification payloads** — add `bettor_name` (truncated address), `market_title`, and a "Copy Bet" action button to VAPID web push payload body. Named notifications achieve 2× CTR vs generic "New bet detected" copy. (Source: BRAIN session 203 Pushwoosh fintech benchmark 2026 — personalization doubles CTR)

- [ ] **Polystrat competitor awareness** — Polystrat (olas.network) is an autonomous AI agent that executes 4,200+ trades/month on Polymarket for users. PolyEdge's copy-notification model (human makes the copy trade decision) is differentiated from fully autonomous execution. Competitive moat: PolyEdge's notification-only model is lower risk and likely compliant where autonomous bots may not be. Consider adding a landing page differentiator: "You control the trade, AI just spots the opportunity." (Source: CoinDesk 2026-03-15 "AI agents quietly rewriting prediction market trading")

- [ ] **Mobile-first UX pass** — modern prediction market platforms (Pariflow) compete on "consumer-first" UX with one-tap execution and highly responsive mobile apps. PolyEdge currently has a mobile nav bar (session 119 confirmed working at 375px) but bettor cards and consensus signals could be more mobile-optimized. Add to FEATURE MODE sprint when mission switches.

## BLOCKED — Needs User Action

- [ ] Configure real Stripe price IDs (STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID, STRIPE_VIP_PRICE_ID) — requires user to update backend/.env
- [ ] Configure TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN — requires user to create bot via @BotFather
